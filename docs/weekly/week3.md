# Week 3: new ideas
## Ideas
1. [Feature Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01223): May be the base for the original project idea.
    - Great work. Ideas: Multi-layer CLIP features + objects addition.
    - Object addition scope: database organization for objects + maybe mesh to 3DGS (TODO: look it up)?
2. [GaussianObject](https://gaussianobject.github.io/): can try adding generation from photos.
3. [Gaussian Editor](https://buaacyw.github.io/gaussian-editor/): object generation to the scene, but without semantic information.
## Worth reading
1. [Contrastive Gaussian Clustering: Weakly Supervised 3D Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12784)
2. [SAGD: Boundary-Enhanced Segment Anything in 3D Gaussian via Gaussian Decomposition](https://github.com/XuHu0529/SAGS)
3. [InFusion: Inpainting 3D Gaussians via Learning Depth Completion from Diffusion Prior](https://johanan528.github.io/Infusion/)
4. [Gaussian Grouping: Segment and Edit Anything in 3D Scenes](https://ymq2017.github.io/gaussian-grouping/).

**Side-idea**: deep dive into 3DGS + SLAM since it's interesting, but it certainly would require much more time to understand 
the topic + limitations.
